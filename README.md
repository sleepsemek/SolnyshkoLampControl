# SolnyshkoLampControl
Alpha version with poor assets and animations. Timer is not set up yet. The app structure is well thought out for future modification.

Main switch outputs:
  "relay:on#" - turn lamp on
  "relay:off#" - turn lamp off
Switch state changing codes:
  "2" - turn button state off
  "1" = turn button state on
