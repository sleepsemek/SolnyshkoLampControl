# SolnyshkoLampControl
Alpha version with poor assets and animations. Timer is not set up yet. The app structure is well thought out for future modification.

Main switch outputs: <br>
  "relay:on#" - turn lamp on <br>
  "relay:off#" - turn lamp off<br>
  "timer:settimer:<seconds>#" - set timer<br>
  
Switch state changing codes:<br>
  "2" - turn button state off<br>
  "4" = timer finished<br>
  "1" = turn button state on<br>
  "3" = timer set<br>
