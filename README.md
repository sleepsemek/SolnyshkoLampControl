# SolnyshkoLampControl
Alpha version with poor assets and animations. Timer is not set up yet. The app structure is well thought out for future modification.

  "relay:on#" - turn lamp on/n
  "relay:off#" - turn lamp off/n
Switch state changing codes:/n
  "2" - turn button state off/n
  "1" = turn button state on/n
